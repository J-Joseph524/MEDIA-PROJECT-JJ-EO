# MEDIA-PROJECT-JJ-EO


## INTRODUCTION:
We are presenting our pitch to Microsoft for recommendations on how to choose the best content for movie production to determine what factors lead to success based on our research & analysis.  

## OBJECTIVE:
Taking a look at the two genres of movies, Adventure and Comedy ranked by revenue, we observe the movies’ the popular votes, budget, and runtime.  

## THE DATASET:
•	TheMovieDB
•	Box Office Mojo


## SKILL REQUIRED TO COMPLETE:
The skills used to complete this project consisted of working with Web Scraping, making API calls, using Python to make visualizations using Pandas.


## WHAT WE POSTED ON GITHUB:
On GitHub we had posted four separate notebooks. One which was consisted of the web scraping code, the other for the code we used to interact with the API, and finally the ReadMe notebook which is a layout of how our project was presented.


## QUESTIONS WE POSED:
1.) Do popular votes influence a movies revenue?
2.) Can the budget of a movie effect the revenue?
3.) Does the length of a movie alter the movies revenue?


## HOW WE PUT OUR DATA TOGETHER:
First, we gathered separate lists of 10,000 Adventure and Comedy movies from TheMovieDB using the API. When we gathered the data, we then ranked the movies based on revenue for each variable we observe. We then condensed our data by narrowing it down to the top 20 movies per genre. Next, we sorted the data of each movie for each genre by highest revenue. That has stayed consistent through out each variable that we compared. For each question in this project, we compared the variables popularity, budget and runtime for each specific genre to see the data trend. Then for each variable we graphed our results to have visualization of the comparison.  


## FUTURE/STEPS WE WOULD HAVE DONE 
The future steps would be using web scraping Box Office Mojo for the worldwide revenue of the movies and then calculate the profit margin and identify the success. In addition, based on the movies released in the last decade, we would also observe if movie franchise had better results than a single story movie. 


## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MICROSOFT
Based on our results from Adventure and Comedy movies we can tell popularity is higher for adventure movies in comparison to comedy. This also leads to noticing the average money spent on producing adventure movies is higher than comedy. The average runtime of the genres also result in adventure movies being longer. In conclusion, Microsoft should invest in making Adventure movies in their studio as it is evident the revenue is higher than comedy movies.
